# TrayPwrD3
Keeps dGPU idle. TrayPwrD3 runs in the background and stays in a tray icon. Single click turns monitor off. Provides several menu options on right click. 

This is to address the [Windows 10 and Optimus problem of stutters and mouse hangs](https://forums.geforce.com/default/topic/860554/geforce-mobile-gpus/windows-10-and-optimus/15/).

For best results run manually after windows starts in order to keep resource utilization low.
